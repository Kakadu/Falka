The main purpose of this tool is to  recover grammar definition from 
parser-combinators and generate for some parser functions another
parser (LALR, recursive descent or something else).

Maybe using this new parser will speedup parsing.

An internal realization of grammar types was adopted from project 
[Recursive-ascent](http://code.google.com/p/recursive-ascent/).
It is a tool similar to yacc but with more features.
