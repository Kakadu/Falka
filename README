The main purpose of this tool is to  recover grammar definition from 
parser-combinators and generate for some parser functions another
parser (LALR, recursive descent or something else).

Maybe using this new parser will speedup parsing.

An internal realization of grammar types was adopted from project 
[Recursive-ascent](http://code.google.com/p/recursive-ascent/).
It is a tool similar to yacc but with more features.

Test  directory contains parsers which use parser-combintaors (Test2 and Test3)
	  modules
Falka contains analyzer of parser-functions' bodies and codegenarator of 
      FsYacc's realizations of some parser-functions.
TushieTest3, TushieTest
      in this directories Falka puts generated source code. Use them to test 
      generated parsers. (TushieTest is directory for Test2).
